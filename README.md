# Python Crash Course

## This is the code repository for [Python Crash Course, 2nd Edition]

I wanted to learn Python, but I didn't want to read a dry, uninteresting textbook. I wanted to read a book that took me through the entire process of writing programs in Python, from start to finish. This book does that. It starts with the basics, such as how to install Python and how to use IDLE, and then it takes you through each step of the program development process. It also covers some of the more advanced features of Python, such as object-oriented programming and data visualization. I've tried to make this book as practical and fun as possible, so that you'll enjoy learning Python, and so that you'll write lots of programs that actually do useful things.

### This link has all the solutions to the exercises in the book. I recommend you try to solve the exercises on your own first, but if you get stuck, you can check the solutions here.
